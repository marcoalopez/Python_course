    ">Meaning **Sci**entific **Py**thon, this library provides some fundamental algorithms for common scientific tasks such as optimization, signal processing, statistics, and more. It works in tandem with Numpy and therefore efficiently. It is a library whose philosophy is to make available well-tested algorithms for science, based in some cases on legacy Fortran or C codes tested for decades (acting Python as a glueing language or wrapper).\n",
