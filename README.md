This is an introductory course to the Python programming language for data analysis using examples from the earth sciences. This course aims to give an overview (breadth rather than depth) of the Python programming language and the main scientific libraries so that you can start using it in your workflow and add a new free scientific analysis tool to your portfolio. The principles of the course are:

- establishing a solid language foundation 

- learning by doing (focus on practice)

- top-down teaching approach

## Prerequisites

The course assumes no previous knowledge of the Python or any other programming language. We assume that the reader is familiar with basic linear algebra and statistics.



## FAQ

#### What is this course not about?

This is not a Python course on image analysis, geochemistry, machine learning or any other specific topic that you can think of. Although you will find examples of different topics, the course is aimed at giving an overview of the language and the Python scientific ecosystem so that you can start using it and go deeper into the topic you want. Nor is it a course where you will learn all the details and machinery behind the Python language (bottom-down approach). Python is simply the programming tool of choice for data analysis because it is free, easy to learn, and a great tool to introduce people to the world of scientific programming.
