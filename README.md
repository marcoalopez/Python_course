# Introduction to the Python programming language for data analysis in earth sciences



This is an introduction to the Python programming language for data analysis using examples from the earth sciences (but not limited...TODO). The aim of this course is to give an overview (breadth rather than depth) of the Python programming language and its different scientific analysis libraries (e.g. Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter notebooks, etc.) to start using it in your data analysis and add a new free scientific analysis tool to your portfolio. The principles of the course are as follows:

- establishing a solid language foundation with a focus on practice

- learning by doing

  

> **What is this course not about?**
>
> This is not a Python course on image analysis, geochemistry, machine learning or any other specific topic that you can think of. Although you will find examples of different topics during the course, for example image analysis, this course is not focused on a specific topic but on giving an overview of the language and the Python scientific ecosystem so that you can start using it and go deeper into the topic you want. Nor is it a course where you will learn all the details and machinery behind the Python language. Python is simply the programming tool of choice for data analysis because it is free and easy to learn.
