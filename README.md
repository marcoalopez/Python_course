This is an introductory course to the Python programming language for data analysis using examples from the earth sciences. This course aims to give an overview (i.e. breadth rather than depth) of the Python programming language and the main scientific analysis libraries to start using it in your data analysis and add a new free scientific analysis tools to your portfolio. The principles of the course are as follows:

- establishing a solid language foundation with a focus on practice

- learning by doing

- top-down teaching approach

  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è At the moment, this repository only contains the notebooks I use to guide the course but no other detailed explanations or the exercises and solutions to the course exercises. I have not yet decided whether I will make the whole course completely open or not. In any case, the walkthrough notebooks have all the necessary explanations (they are self-contained) and you can use them for free to learn about this topic.



## Walkthrough notebooks (üö® in development!)

- Install Python using anaconda (available soon)

- [The Python programming language: getting started](https://github.com/marcoalopez/Python_course/blob/main/notebooks/Python_walkthrough.ipynb)
- [Matplotlib overview: the scientific plotting library ](https://github.com/marcoalopez/Python_course/blob/main/notebooks/Matplotlib_walkthrough.ipynb)
- [Numpy ("numerical Python") overview](https://github.com/marcoalopez/Python_course/blob/main/notebooks/Numpy_walkthrough.ipynb)
- [Pandas overview](https://github.com/marcoalopez/Python_course/blob/main/notebooks/Pandas_walkthrough.ipynb)
- Scipy ("scientific Python") overview
- [Object-oriented Python for sciences: the basics](https://github.com/marcoalopez/Python_course/blob/main/notebooks/OOP4science_walkthrough.ipynb)



## Prerequisites

The course assumes no previous knowledge of the Python or any other programming language. We assume that the reader is familiar with notions of linear algebra and statistics.



## FAQ

#### What is this course not about?

This is not a Python course on image analysis, geochemistry, machine learning or any other specific topic that you can think of. Although you will find examples of different topics during the course, this course is aimed at giving an overview of the language and the Python scientific ecosystem so that you can start using it and go deeper into the topic you want. Nor is it a course where you will learn all the details and machinery behind the Python language. Python is simply the programming tool of choice for data analysis because it is free, easy to learn, and a great tool to introduce people to the world of scientific programming.
